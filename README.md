How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by trying not to hard code, by writing the right code commands to read and write, and by using the open/closed principle for extensions and modifications to add functionality.
What were the advantages of working in this way?
The advantages of working with the CRUD Python module to connect the dashboard widgets to the database are: it allowed me to call commands from the database to upload them into the dashboard widgets, it allowed the Python code to work with MongoDB database, and it allowed me to download the database into the dashboard widgets with the use of Python.
How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I can use this CRUD Python module in the future by calling commands to get different documents from the MongoDB database.
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
I would try to understand the problem, then I would break it down into smaller steps, then I would use an algorithm or a data structure to figure it out, then I would write the code, and finally I would review the code to get all of the errors out and debug the code to make sure it functions properly.
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
My approach to the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested in the project differs from previous assignments in other courses, because it took a while to pull up and get the database and dashboard running properly, while other assignments in other courses I only had to figure the right code to the the right output to get the programs working.
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
The techniques or strategies that I would use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests would be by using these commands: cd /usr/local/datasets
mongoimport --username="${MONGO_USER}" \
    --password="${MONGO_PASS}" --port=${MONGO_PORT} \
    --host=${MONGO_HOST} --db enron --collection emails \ 
    --authenticationDatabase admin --drop ./enron.json, I would use mongosh to pull up the MongoDB database, and I would only change the host and authenticationDatabase if I need to.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
They create software, hardware, and computing tech. This all helps to figure out hard problems.
How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
My work on this type of project helps a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better, by helping them to figure out a CRUD Python module that called for the MongoDB database that helped to create a Dashboard that had the Animal Shelter Rescue info and map that helped them to pinpoint the right animal and location that they need.
